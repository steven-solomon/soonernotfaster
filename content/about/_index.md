My name is Steven Solomon, I am a Lead Software Engineer at [Stride Consulting](https://www.stridenyc.com/) in NYC. I have been writing software professionally since 2007. My work has spanned many sectors, such as: publishing, retail, finance, loyalty, healthcare, and education. This work also took place with various different programming languages: C#, JavaScript, Ruby, TypeScript, Java, and Elixir. No matter the sector and language I seek to help make the lives of people better with software. 

Software provides an opportunity to automate the boring rote tasks of day to day life, allowing time for more fulfilling activities. On the team, software is expressive and embodies the domain language, so that everyone can understand and change any part of the system. For customers, it means that the team has taken the time to understand the use-cases and pressures of using the software, and is actively trying to craft a streamlined experience. Great software is like any great tool, it amplifies the effectiveness of a person completing a task.

I try to live out the values of simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage in everything I do in my work. This includes helping create situations where collaboration is easy, knowledge silos are minimized, code is readable and changeable by anyone, making sure I am in a position to help unblock the team, and the everyone is empowered to change our process. 

As my career continues to progress, I want to share what I have learned with others in the software industry through writing and speaking. This site contains my blog posts, a book I am actively working on—available now on LeanPub, and a list of the talks I have given. I hope you find the content fun, engaging, and informative. 

Happy Coding

Steve Solomon
