My name is Steven Solomon, I am a Lead Software Engineer at [Stride Consulting](https://www.stridenyc.com/) in NYC. I have been writing software professionally since 2007. My work has spanned many sectors, such as: publishing, retail, finance, loyalty, healthcare, and education. This work also took place with various different programming languages: C#, JavaScript, Ruby, TypeScript, Java, and Elixir. No matter the sector and language I seek to help make the lives of people better with software. 

Software provides an opportunity to automate the boring rote tasks of day to day life, allowing time for more fulfilling activities. On the team, software is expressive and embodies the domain language, so that everyone can understand and change any part of the system. For customers, it means that the team has taken the time to understand the context and ways the software is used, and is actively trying to craft a streamlined experience. Great software is like any great tool, it amplifies the effectiveness of a person completing a task.

In the same way software amplifies the effectiveness of the customer, I work to build up my team by trying to model the values of simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage in everything I do. This includes helping create situations where collaboration is fun and easy, the code being written is readable and changeable by anyone, I am in a position to help the team, and everyone is empowered to participate in crafting our process. 

As my career continues to progress, I want to share what I have learned with those I don't get to work with on a daily basis through my writing and technical talks. This site contains my blog posts, and a book I am actively working onâ€”[available now on LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/agilesoftware). I hope you find the content fun, engaging, and informative. 

Happy Coding

Steve Solomon
