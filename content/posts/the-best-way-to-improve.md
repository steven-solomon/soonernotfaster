There is a lot written about how to improve, and what you should start doing. Sometimes the most impactful thing to do is to stop doing something.
For example pull requests. How are pull requests benefiting your team? Are they painful and slow? Fast and easy? How long after work on a feature is complete does it take to merge it? If the effects seem to have a negative impact, try stopping for a time.

Another example, that Monday meeting. How would it affect your team if it didn’t happen for a few weeks? Would productivity decrease? Increase? By how much?

Before starting to stop, ask yourself for quantities not just qualities. Decide what you will do if those changes result in an increase and decrease. “Try it and see what happens” shouldn’t be a phrase uttered. Saying that, guaranties future discussions will be based on opinions and not facts.

Now that the prediction is in writing, notice how right or wrong we were. In both cases, celebrate what was learned. When learning is valued and celebrated, your team continuously improves.
