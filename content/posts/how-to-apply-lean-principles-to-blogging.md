I always wanted to write blog posts but I was afraid. Thoughts like “what if … I’m wrong, make grammatical errors, nobody reads my posts” really held me back from publishing what I had written. So, I used lean techniques to publish early and often.

Once I started using a lean approach, I saw my fear subside and I have now been publishing for a few months. I want to share my approach to blogging, so that those of you who have been holding back have a way to start.

# How I Started Blogging

I was recently on a team with Cat Robinson, she was our team designer. In addition to having great design instincts, she pushed our team to improve, recommending that our team define professional goals.

Following a goal brainstorming exercise, I decided that my goal was to begin publishing blog posts. I had attempted to write in the past but I was always too scared to publish them.

# Small Blog Posts, Often

When trying to publish I had a lot of fears that would float through my mind. I would think “what if my ideas weren’t good?”, “what if I was outright wrong?”, and “what if I made silly grammar and spelling errors?”

*One day I realized that I could treat blogs like software. I could publish small posts, often.*

So I got to “production” the fastest way I knew, I wrote a “First” post. No literally, I wrote a post with the text “First” and then I pushed the publish button.

I realized everything was okay, nothing set on fire, I wasn’t dead. In fact I was more confident.

# Iterating

When deciding on my next topic to write about, I looked for events from my day to day life. As an engineer most of these topics were either technical or about team communication. I would pay attention to how I felt about the idea, if it didn’t excite me I would let it pass. (This is a technique from Weinberg on Writing).

Once I had a topic that I felt passionate about. I would set a timer for 5 minutes and write as many thoughts I had about that topic on sticky notes (one idea per sticky). The time constraint helped me focus on the task at hand.
Once the timer rang, I organized the stickies into related thoughts. The groups became my main points to make in the post.

With my main points laid out, I began writing. Again, I set a timer, now it was used to time box writing about one of the main points. I did this for each point.

Once all the main points were written, I wrote the conclusion. I then took that conclusion and made it my introduction. This made sure that there was a robust TLDR; at the beginning of my articles. Then I would write a second “real” conclusion.

Now comes the rote bit, I had to proofread the heck out of it. I was very nervous about spelling and grammar errors, so I proofread the article 3 times.

However, I didn’t make structural changes. The point was to get something out quickly, then iterate. If I spent too much time reworking the article, it would never publish.

Finally, I pressed that publish button for the second time. I made sure to share the link on all of my social media accounts. Sharing opened the door to feedback, which I used to iterate on writing style in future posts.
Then I repeat the process.

# Conclusion

Using lean techniques helped me have the courage to start blogging. I hope that small batch sizes and limiting over editing of articles will help you start as well.

I can’t wait to read your posts!
